# TankWars

TankWars is automatically played by the computer, pitting a user-selected number of teams and tanks against each other.

TankWars was the final project in University of California, Irvine course Game Engine with Unity.
Students were required to incrementally design a tank wars game throughout the course.
At the end of the course, our games were given out to other students randomly in order for them to complete.
This project forced us to design and work with an unfamiliar game and unfamiliar code.
